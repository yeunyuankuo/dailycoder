      <description>We can push our new branch to the repository with the git push command. But here we also want to set the upstream branch.

      <description>I was asked this question in one of my recent software engineer job interviews, and I believe I didn’t answer it as well as I would have liked, so I wanted to write this blog to re-answer it and perhaps aid someone else who is also curious about the solution&amp;hellip;</description>
