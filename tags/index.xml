      <description>‚ÄúAn important sign of Kubernetes momentum is the continuing shift to production, growing from 59% in the 2020 report to 65% this year. Companies with more than 500 developers were more likely to be running all or most containerized workloads in production (78%). In our first State of Kubernetes report in 2018, less than a third (30%) reported running Kubernetes in production.‚Äù

      <title>Why is goroutine being called a ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù thread?</title>
      <link>https://yeunyuankuo.github.io/2022/03/goroutine-lightweight/</link>

      <description>I was asked this question in one of my recent software engineer job interviews, and I believe I didn‚Äôt answer it as well as I would have liked, so I wanted to write this blog to re-answer it and perhaps aid someone else who is also curious about the solution.
 In Go articles, we often see goroutine introduced as a lightweight thread. But why is it lightweight? how lightweight?</description>
