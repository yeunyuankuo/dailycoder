      <description>I was asked this question in one of my recent software engineer job interviews, and I believe I didn‚Äôt answer it as well as I would have liked, so I wanted to write this blog to re-answer it and perhaps aid someone else who is also curious about the solution.
 In Go articles, we often see goroutine introduced as a lightweight thread. But why is it lightweight? how lightweight?</description>
